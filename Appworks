	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Use camelCase or PascalCase consistently across all fields.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Field names should reflect business meaning, not technical implementation.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Avoid abbreviations unless they are industry-standard (e.g., DOB, ID).
	‚Ä¢	‚ùå Don‚Äôt use vague names like value1, data, or tempField.

‚∏ª

2. Data Type-Specific Naming Patterns
Data Type	Suggested Prefix / Suffix	Examples
Text/String	No strict rule	firstName, comments
Number	count, amount, qty	invoiceAmount, itemCount
Boolean	is, has, can, should	isActive, hasConsent, canApprove
Date/Time	date, on, at, timestamp	createdDate, approvedOn, startTime
Category	status, type, category	customerType, orderStatus
Reference	Id, Ref	customerId, orderRef
Collection	Plural naming	items, approvers, documents

3. Entity-Specific Field Naming Tips
	‚Ä¢	For primary ID fields, use entityNameId format:
	‚Ä¢	e.g., customerId, invoiceId
	‚Ä¢	For related entity fields, make relationship clear:
	‚Ä¢	e.g., parentCustomerId, linkedCaseId

‚∏ª

4. Boolean Fields Naming

‚úÖ Always start boolean fields with is, has, can, or should.

Examples:
	‚Ä¢	isVerified
	‚Ä¢	hasAttachments
	‚Ä¢	canEdit

‚ùå Avoid names like status = 0/1 to represent booleans.

‚∏ª

5. Date/Time Fields Naming

‚úÖ Always suffix with Date, On, At, or Timestamp.

Examples:
	‚Ä¢	createdDate
	‚Ä¢	submittedOn
	‚Ä¢	lastModifiedAt

‚∏ª

6. Dropdown / Picklist / Category Fields

‚úÖ Use suffixes like Type, Category, Status.

Examples:
	‚Ä¢	userType
	‚Ä¢	documentCategory
	‚Ä¢	leadStatus

‚∏ª

7. Currency and Amount Fields

‚úÖ Always use Amount or Value.

Examples:
	‚Ä¢	totalAmount
	‚Ä¢	discountValue
	‚Ä¢	approvedBudgetAmount

‚∏ª

8. Consistency and Readability

Here are the Best Practices for Document Handling in OpenText AppWorks, focusing on security, storage, classification, integration, and user experience:

‚∏ª

üìÑ AppWorks Document Best Practices

‚∏ª

1. Document Entity Design
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Use a dedicated entity like Ent_Document or Ent_Attachment to manage files.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Fields to include:
	‚Ä¢	documentName, documentType, uploadedBy, uploadedOn, relatedEntityId, documentStatus
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Store document metadata separately from the actual file.
	‚Ä¢	‚ùå Avoid embedding binary data directly in business entities.

‚∏ª

2. Storage Strategy
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Use Document Management Services (DMS) like OpenText Content Server or Documentum for storage.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Use references to content rather than storing files inside AppWorks entities.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Set up lifecycle policies: archive/delete older documents after X months/years.

‚∏ª

3. Naming Conventions
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Document name pattern:
DOC_<Entity>_<Type>_<Date>_<ID>
Example: DOC_Invoice_PDF_20250711_12345.pdf
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Use lowercase or underscores for system fields (e.g., doc_type, uploaded_by).
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Keep file extensions consistent (e.g., .pdf, .docx, .xls).

‚∏ª

4. Classification & Metadata
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Tag documents with:
	‚Ä¢	Category (e.g., Legal, Financial, HR)
	‚Ä¢	Type (e.g., Contract, Invoice, Report)
	‚Ä¢	Confidentiality (e.g., Public, Internal, Restricted)
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Use dropdowns or taxonomy values to enforce consistency.

‚∏ª

5. Security & Access Control
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Control who can view, upload, download, or delete based on role.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Use AppWorks ACLs or group-level access restrictions.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Mask/hide confidential document fields for unauthorized users.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Enable document versioning and audit logs.

‚∏ª

6. Integration & APIs
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Use AppWorks REST APIs to:
	‚Ä¢	Upload and retrieve documents
	‚Ä¢	Trigger actions when documents are uploaded
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Integrate with external DMS via APIs to store/retrieve content
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Maintain linkage between AppWorks document entity and external system doc ID

‚∏ª

7. UI & User Experience
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Provide clear document upload controls in forms.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Show document list in tabular format with:
	‚Ä¢	Name, Type, Uploaded By, Uploaded Date, Download Link
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Allow bulk uploads and multiple file formats.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Add preview (PDF/image viewer) when possible.

‚∏ª

8. Document Versioning
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Track changes by maintaining:
	‚Ä¢	versionNumber, versionDate, changedBy, changeReason
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Allow rollback or view previous versions
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Don‚Äôt overwrite files ‚Äî use append and version logic

‚∏ª

9. Workflow Integration
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Trigger workflow actions (like approval or rejection) when a document is:
	‚Ä¢	Uploaded
	‚Ä¢	Modified
	‚Ä¢	Deleted
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Use document statuses in workflow transitions:
	‚Ä¢	Example: Only proceed if ‚ÄúSigned Contract‚Äù is uploaded

‚∏ª

10. Audit & Compliance
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Maintain an audit trail for all document events:
	‚Ä¢	Created, Modified, Accessed, Deleted
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Log which user performed which action
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Retain documents per regulatory/compliance guidelines (e.g., GDPR, ISO)

Here are the Best Practices for Using Rules in OpenText AppWorks ‚Äî focused on validation, business logic, performance, and maintainability:

‚∏ª

üìú AppWorks Rule Best Practices

‚∏ª

1. Naming Conventions
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Use consistent prefixes:
	‚Ä¢	Rule_ for general rules (e.g., Rule_ValidateEmail)
	‚Ä¢	Calc_ for calculation rules (e.g., Calc_TotalAmount)
	‚Ä¢	Val_ for validations (e.g., Val_CheckDueDate)
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Use descriptive names: what the rule does, not where it is used.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Group related rules using RuleGroups.

‚∏ª

2. Rule Grouping and Organization
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Use Rule Groups for:
	‚Ä¢	Validation rules
	‚Ä¢	Business logic
	‚Ä¢	Calculations
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Organize rule groups by purpose:
	‚Ä¢	Example: RG_CustomerValidations, RG_OrderCalculations
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Place rules close to their logical context (e.g., inside the relevant entity)

‚∏ª

3. Rule Types and When to Use Them
Rule Type	Use Case Example
Validation Rule	Ensure email format, mandatory field check
Calculation Rule	Compute tax, discount, totals
Business Rule	Workflow triggers, custom routing
OnCreate/OnSave	Auto-set status, initialize fields
OnStatusChange	Lock fields, send notifications
Choose rule type based on when and why the logic must run.

‚∏ª

4. Best Practices for Rule Logic
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Keep rules simple and focused ‚Äî one purpose per rule.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Avoid complex nested IF statements. Use switch/case or decision tables instead.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Use categories or system values for comparisons instead of hard-coded values.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Reuse global constants and functions wherever possible.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Validate early ‚Äî use rules to prevent bad data entry before saving.

‚∏ª

5. Performance Optimization
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Minimize expensive operations (e.g., database lookups inside loops).
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Avoid calling APIs within frequent rules like OnCreate unless essential.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Use efficient condition structures ‚Äî avoid unnecessary checks.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Use caching if calling external services repeatedly.

‚∏ª

6. Error Handling and Logging
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Log rule failures to an audit or tracking entity.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Gracefully handle rule failures ‚Äî give user-friendly error messages.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Use debug logging in test environments (disable in production).

‚∏ª

7. Versioning and Documentation
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Add comments inside rules to explain the logic.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Use version suffixes if rule logic evolves (e.g., Rule_CalculateFee_v2)
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Document all business-critical rules in shared Confluence/Docs.

‚∏ª

8. Security and Governance
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Avoid placing sensitive access logic inside rules (use AppWorks ACL instead).
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Ensure rule-based decisions do not leak sensitive data (e.g., show/hide controls).
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Assign ownership of rules to developers or business analysts for tracking.

‚∏ª

9. Testing and Reusability
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Test each rule independently using mock/test entities.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Use reusable rule logic across entities where appropriate.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Avoid duplication ‚Äî centralize logic into shared rules when possible.

‚∏ª

10. Common Examples
	‚Ä¢	Rule_ValidateEmailFormat
	‚Ä¢	Rule_CalculateInvoiceTotal
	‚Ä¢	Rule_TriggerEscalationIfOverdue
	‚Ä¢	Rule_SetDefaultOwnerOnCreate
	‚Ä¢	Rule_AutoCloseTicketOnStatusChange
